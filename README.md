# Developing-Python-Packages
In this course, I learned about package structure, essential files for packaging, import structure, documentation, and maintaining code style with flake8. I used templates and cookiecutter to create package skeletons. Lastly, I learned to use setuptools and twine to build and publish packages to PyPI.
