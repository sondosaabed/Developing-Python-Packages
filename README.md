# Developing-Python-Packages
In this course, I learned about package structure, essential files for packaging, import structure, documentation, and maintaining code style with flake8. I used templates and cookiecutter to create package skeletons. Lastly, I learned to use setuptools and twine to build and publish packages to PyPI.

## Course's chapters
- **Chapter 1: From Loose Code to Local Package:** In this chapter, I got the package started by converting scripts I have already written. I have created a simple package which I can use on my own computer.

- **Chapter 2: Install Your Package from Anywhere:** In this chapter, I made my package installable for myself and others. I have also learned to deal with dependencies, write READMEs, and include licenses. I also completed all the steps to publish the package on PyPIâ€”the main home of Python packages.

- **Chapter 3: Increasing Your Package Quality:** In this chapter, I bring my package up to a professional standard. Discovered how to use pytest to guard against errors, tox to test if the package functions with multiple versions of Python, and flake8 to maintain great code style.

- **Chapter 4: Rapid Package Development:** In the final chapter, I have create my packages more quickly. I have learn how to use cookiecutter to generate all the supporting files the package needs, Makefiles to simplify releasing new versions, and was introduced to the last few files my package needs to attract users and contributors.
